    <h1>How to Build a PC</h1>
    <!-- Used p tag here -->
    <p>Starting off this may seem like a daunting task, but if you break it down it is actually quite a simple one. 
    It's a lot like legos, you buy much overpriced merchandice and put it together to make something that is really
    cool. It can be a whole lot of fun if you let it be, or very frustrating if you don't.</p>
    <div class="cities">
    <!-- Used h3 tag and hex color #ff0000 here --> 
    <h3>Buying the Parts</h3>
    <!-- Used p tag here -->
    <p>This is probably the biggest and most important part of building a pc, just like prep work is one of the most 
    important parts for a chef. If it isn't done, nothing can be made. First off you need a budget. For about $300 
    you can probably make the bare minimum to run anything basic, such as google chrome or internet explorer, and 
    other basic computer programs. Get up near $800 and you can have yourself a very nice office type computer that 
    runs smoothly for what you would need it for for that type of job. If you want to game, then you can make 
    something anywhere from $800 to $3000 depending on what how you want everything to run while gaming and what 
    your income is looking like. Programming and CPU heavy programs will also be up there in price.</p>
    <!-- Used p tag here -->
    <p>Now with all of that said, you have to go about buying the actual parts. A website that I would highly 
    recommend is
    <!-- Used b tag here -->
    <b>pcpartpicker.com</b>. I would suggest finding all of the parts you want except the motherboard first,
    and finding the case last. So maybe go in this order:
    <!-- Used ul, li, and list-style-type:square tags here -->
    <ul style="list-style-type:square"><li>CPU</li><li>GPU</li>
    <li>RAM</li><li>CPU Cooling Unit</li><li>Hard Drive</li><li>Power Supply</li><li>Motherboard</li><li>Case</li></ul> 
    Now you can also get a wireless network adapter if you aren't going to be running an ethernet cable directly
    into your PC. Now the reason I told you to pick out your motherboard after the parts, is because you have to 
    make sure that the motherboard you pick is compatable with all the other parts that you picked otherwise you 
    will have a PC that will not run. Now then after that you buy the case because you have to make sure you get
    a case that your motherboard can fit into.</p>

    <h3>Putting it Together</h3>
    <!-- Used p tag here -->
    <p>Now that you have all the pieces, and your bank acount has taken a serious blow, let's put it together.
    This part is very simple, but I can't really walk you through it on paper. So I'll give you a few tips then 
    direct you to the video that I used the first time I build one. First off, as you will see in the video, 
    you want to get yourself an 
    <!-- Used i tag here -->
    <i>anti static wrist strap</i>, especially if you are working with $600 parts.
    Second, don't force anything that doesn't want to go where you are trying to put it. Now RAM takes a little
    bit of a push, but even with that, make sure you're putting it in the right way. You don't want to break 
    anything. Finally, if you really are just scared of doing it, find a friend who knows what they are doing, 
    and they will be more than happy to help. This is a very fun thing to do so I think anyone would turn you 
    down if you asked for a bit of help. Finally

    is that video to walk you through the process.</p>
